I created my web portfolio to best suit me and my style, and to best compliment the work I am showcasing. Some challenges I faced during the development of my web portfolio were getting each page to be optimized to multiple screen sizes. I worked through trial and error to complete the task. Another struggle I faced was making the image grid on the portfolio page, because the images were different sizes it made it more difficult to work with. Some things I learned while creating my web portfolio was working with images better and using grid because I havenâ€™t had much experience with it so I learned more about it as well as making the images and grid responsive for multiple screen sizes. Some resources I used were the imdac website to look over previous slides to figure out what elements would work best with the things I was trying to create. I also used google fonts for the fonts on my page and font awesome for the social media icons. All of the images that were used on my web portfolio are my images and artwork.
